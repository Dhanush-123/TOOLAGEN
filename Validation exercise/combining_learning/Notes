Question 

1. Use delegates (e.g., Func) inside a service to perform a calculation (such as discount on product prices) and return the result via an API endpoint. 
2. Implement a LINQ query that selects products where the price is greater than a certain amount, and return the filtered result via an API action


Get Discounted Products
http://localhost:5104/api/products/discounted?discountPercentage=10

Get Filtered Products
http://localhost:5104/api/products/filtered?priceThreshold=500

Invalid Discount Percentage
http://localhost:5104/api/products/discounted?discountPercentage=100
